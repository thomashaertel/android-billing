        * WARNING: Locally generating a random string when starting a purchase and
        * verifying it here might seem like a good approach, but this will fail in the
        * case where the user purchases an item on one device and then uses your app on
        * a different device, because on the other device you will not have access to the
        * random string you originally generated.
        *
        * So a good developer payload has these characteristics:
        *
        * 1. If two different users purchase an item, the payload is different between them,
        * so that one user's purchase can't be replayed to another user.
        *
        * 2. The payload must be such that you can verify it even when the app wasn't the
        * one who initiated the purchase flow (so that items purchased by the user on
        * one device work on other devices owned by the user).
        *
        * Using your own server to store and verify developer payloads across app
        * installations is recommended.
